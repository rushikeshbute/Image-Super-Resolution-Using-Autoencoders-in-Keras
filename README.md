# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders-in-Keras
 In this project, youâ€™re going to learn what an autoencoder is, use Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train your own autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, our neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.

# Learning Objectives
* Understand what autoencoders are and why they are used
* Design and train an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras
